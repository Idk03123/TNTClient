Hello This is my new minecraft launcher called TNTClient what makes it so special is that you can disable mods right in the menu. But in the normal minecraft launcher you have to remove them from your mods folder.
Next my client can load any minecraft version from 1.19 to the latest snapshot in less than 30 seconds No more waiting forevr for other clients to download minecrafts files.
This is in beta and im a kid so theres not mulitplayer. YETbut you can still play with each other in the same world with minecrafts port hsting ut only they can join you. We bring Fps boosts and you scroll down and select vanilla or fabric it takes less than 5 seconds to download any version of fabric from simply in the app.
This application can only be ran in files its not an app that can be on your pc anyways thanks trying my new launcher hope it helps.
